* ARM PVT Thermal Sensor

** Node properties:

- compatible : "arm,arm-pvt";
- reg : address range of the pvt sensor registers;
- trip-pointN : optional sub-node describing the Nth trip point. It has the
  following mandatory properties -
	- temp : trip temperature in milliCelsius
	- type : trip point type, should be one of "active", "passive", "hot"
	or "critical"
  Trip point can also optionally define the following sub-node -
	- cdevM : defines a cpu frequency based Mth cooling device with the following
	mandatory property -
		- cluster : phandle of the cluster this cooling device will control

Example:
arm_pvt@7fff0300 {
	compatible = "arm,arm-pvt";
	reg = <0 0x7fff0300 0 0x001c>;

	trip-point0 {
		temp = <40000>;
		type = "active";
		cdev0 {
			cluster = <&cluster0>;
		};
		cdev1 {
			cluster = <&cluster1>;
		};
	};
	trip-point1 {
		temp = <55000>;
		type = "critical";
	};
};

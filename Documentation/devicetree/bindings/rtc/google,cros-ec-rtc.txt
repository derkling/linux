* Chromium OS EC RTC

The Chromium OS EC can function as an RTC in systems that lack a discrete
RTC device. The RTC supports basic time and alarm functions, including alarms
that can wake up the device from suspend.

An EC RTC node should be only found as a sub-node of the EC node (see
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mfd/cros-ec.txt).

Required properties:
- compatible: Must contain "google,cros-ec-rtc"

Example:
	cros-ec@0 {
		compatible = "google,cros-ec-spi";

		...

		cros_ec_rtc: ec-rtc {
			compatible = "google,cros-ec-rtc";
		};
	};

MediaTek display PWM controller

Required properties:
 - compatible: should be "mediatek,<name>-disp-pwm"
   - "mediatek,mt8173-disp-pwm": found on mt8173 SoC
   - "mediatek,mt6595-disp-pwm": found on mt6595 SoC
 - reg: physical base address and length of the controller's registers
 - #pwm-cells: must be 2. See pwm.txt in this directory for a description of
   the cell format
 - clocks: phandle and clock specifier of the PWM reference clock
 - clock-names: must contain the following
   - "main": clock used to generate PWM signals
   - "mm": sync signals from the modules of mmsys

Example:
	pwm0: pwm@1401e000 {
		compatible = "mediatek,mt8173-disp-pwm",
			     "mediatek,mt6595-disp-pwm";
		reg = <0 0x1401e000 0 0x1000>;
		#pwm-cells = <2>;
		clocks = <&mmsys MM_DISP_PWM026M>,
			 <&mmsys MM_DISP_PWM0MM>;
		clock-names = "main", "mm";
	};

* ARM Generic Interrupt Controller

ARM SMP cores are often associated with a GIC, providing per processor
interrupts (PPI), shared processor interrupts (SPI) and software
generated interrupts (SGI).

Primary GIC is attached directly to the CPU and typically has PPIs and SGIs.
Secondary GICs are cascaded into the upward interrupt controller and do not
have PPIs or SGIs.

Main node required properties:

- compatible : should be one of:
	"arm,cortex-a9-gic"
	"arm,arm11mp-gic"
- interrupt-controller : Identifies the node as an interrupt controller
- #interrupt-cells : Specifies the number of cells needed to encode an
  interrupt source.  The type shall be a <u32> and the value shall be 3.

  The 1st cell is the interrupt type; 0 for SPI interrupts, 1 for PPI
  interrupts.

  The 2nd cell contains the interrupt number for the interrupt type.
  SPI interrupts are in the range [0-987].  PPI interrupts are in the
  range [0-15].

  The 3rd cell is the flags, encoded as follows:
	bits[3:0] trigger type and level flags.
		1 = low-to-high edge triggered
		2 = high-to-low edge triggered
		4 = active high level-sensitive
		8 = active low level-sensitive
	bits[15:8] PPI interrupt cpu mask.  Each bit corresponds to each of
	the 8 possible cpus attached to the GIC.  A bit set to '1' indicated
	the interrupt is wired to that CPU.  Only valid for PPI interrupts.

- reg : Specifies base physical address(s) and size of the GIC registers. The
  first region is the GIC distributor register base and size. The 2nd region is
  the GIC cpu interface register base and size.

Optional
- interrupts	: Interrupt source of the parent interrupt controller. Only
  present on secondary GICs.

- cpu-offset	: per-cpu offset within the distributor and cpu interface
  regions, used when the GIC doesn't have banked registers. The offset is
  cpu-offset * cpu-nr.

Example:

	intc: interrupt-controller@fff11000 {
		compatible = "arm,cortex-a9-gic";
		#interrupt-cells = <3>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		interrupt-controller;
		reg = <0xfff11000 0x1000>,
		      <0xfff10100 0x100>;
	};

* ARM Generic Interrupt Controller CPU Interfaces

ARM GIC device tree nodes contain subnodes representing its CPU interfaces.

The main properties required by CPU interface nodes are:

- compatible	: "arm,gic-cpuif"
- cpuif-id	: specifies the CPU IF HW identifier
- cpu		: a phandle to the respective CPU node

Example:

	cpus {
		#size-cells = <0>;
		#address-cells = <1>;

		CPU0: cpu@0x0 {
			device_type = "cpu";
			reg = <0x0>;
		};

		CPU1: cpu@0x1 {
			device_type = "cpu";
			reg = <0x1>;
		};

		CPU2: cpu@0x100 {
			device_type = "cpu";
			reg = <0x100>;
		};

		CPU3: cpu@0x101 {
			device_type = "cpu";
			reg = <0x101>;
		};
	};

	intc: interrupt-controller@fff11000 {
		compatible = "arm,cortex-a9-gic";
		#interrupt-cells = <3>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		interrupt-controller;
		reg = <0xfff11000 0x1000>,
		      <0xfff10100 0x100>;

			gic-cpuif@0x0 {
				compatible = "arm,gic-cpuif";
				cpuif-id = <0x0>;
				cpu = <&CPU0>;
			};

			gic-cpuif@0x1 {
				compatible = "arm,gic-cpuif";
				cpuif-id = <0x1>;
				cpu = <&CPU1>;
			};

			gic-cpuif@0x2 {
				compatible = "arm,gic-cpuif";
				cpuif-id = <0x2>;
				cpu = <&CPU2>;
			};

			gic-cpuif@0x3 {
				compatible = "arm,gic-cpuif";
				cpuif-id = <0x3>;
				cpu = <&CPU3>;
			};
	};

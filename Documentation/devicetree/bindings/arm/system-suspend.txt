ARM system suspend binding description
==========================================

==========================================
1 - Introduction
==========================================

System Suspend(commonly known as Suspend to RAM) is a method to remove
power from most parts of the machine aside from the RAM, which is required
to restore the machine's state. Because of the large power savings, it is
widely used in mobile systems like laptops, tablets and smartphones.

Usually most mobile systems enter system suspend state aggressively when
they are idle even for short time(in seconds) while others systems like
laptops automatically enter this mode when they running on batteries and
the lid is closed (and/or the user is inactive for some time(in minutes)).

Most of the devices in the system are deactivated. Non-volatile memory
(like disk drives, flash, memory card), graphics chips and even the CPU
are usually deactivated. Only the RAM is powered to keep its contents. On
resume, only those individual devices/CPUs need to be reinitialized and
work continues relatively fast.

It is highly hardware specific especially on ARM platforms. Hence we need
device tree binding definition for ARM system suspend state which is the
subject of this document in order to provide generic solution.

===========================================
2 - system suspend node
===========================================

The system suspend node represents the description of the mechanism to
enter system suspend state and must be defined as follows:

	- compatible
		Usage: Required
		Value type: <stringlist>
		Definition: Must be "arm,system-suspend";

	- entry-method
		Value type: <stringlist>
		Usage and definition depend on ARM architecture version.
			# On ARM v8 64-bit this property is required and must
			  be one of:
			   - "arm,psci" (see bindings in [1])

	- status:
		Usage: Optional
		Value type: <string>
		Definition: A standard device tree property [2] that indicates
			    the operational status of system suspend.
			    If present, it shall be:
			    "okay": to indicate it is operational.
			    "disabled": to indicate that it has been disabled
			                in firmware so it is not operational.
			    By default, it's always enabled if not explicitly
			    disabled.

	In addition to the properties listed above, it may require additional
	properties specifics to the entry-method defined, please refer to the
	corresponding entry-method bindings documentation for details.
	In the below example using "arm,psci" entry method,
	"arm,psci-suspend-param" is a PSCI specific property.

	The system suspend node's parent node must be the 'cpus' node.

3 - Examples
===========================================

Example:
cpus {
	/* cpu-map, cpu and idle-states nodes */
	....

	system-suspend {
		compatible = "arm,system-suspend";
		entry-method = "arm,psci";
		arm,psci-suspend-param = <0x1010000>;
	};

	....
};

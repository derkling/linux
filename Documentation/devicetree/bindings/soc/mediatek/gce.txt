MediaTek GCE
===============

The Global Command Engine (GCE) is used to help read/write registers with
critical time limitation, such as updating display configuration during the
vblank. The GCE can be used to implement the Command Queue (CMDQ) driver.
Currently, the GCE only supports display related hardwares, but we expect
it can be extended to other hardwares for future requirements.

Required properties:
- compatible: Must be "mediatek,mt8173-gce"
- reg: Address range of the GCE unit
- interrupts: The interrupt signal from the GCE block
- clock: Clocks according to the common clock binding
- clock-names: Must be "gce" to stand for GCE clock

Example:

	gce: gce@10212000 {
		compatible = "mediatek,mt8173-gce";
		reg = <0 0x10212000 0 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 135 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;
		clocks = <&infracfg CLK_INFRA_GCE>;
		clock-names = "gce";
	};

	mmsys: clock-controller@14000000 {
		compatible = "mediatek,mt8173-mmsys", "syscon";
		reg = <0 0x14000000 0 0x1000>;
		power-domains = <&scpsys MT8173_POWER_DOMAIN_MM>;
		#clock-cells = <1>;
		mediatek,gce = <&gce>;
	};

* H1 Secure Microcontroller with Cr50 Firmware on SPI Bus.

H1 Secure Microcontroller running Cr50 firmware provides several
functions, including TPM-like functionality. It communicates over
SPI using the FIFO protocol described in the PTP Spec, section 6.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "google,cr50".
- spi-max-frequency: Maximum SPI frequency.

Optional properties:
- access-delay-ms: Required delay between subsequent transactions on SPI.
- sleep-delay-ms: Time after the last SPI activity, after which the chip
  may go to sleep.
- wake-start-delay-ms: Time after initiating wake up before the chip is
  ready to accept commands over SPI.

Example:

&spi0 {
        status = "okay";

        cr50@0 {
                compatible = "google,cr50";
                reg = <0>;
                spi-max-frequency = <800000>;

                access-delay-ms = <2>;
                sleep-delay-ms = <1000>;
                wake-start-delay-ms = <60>;
        };
};

MT65xx U3PHY

The device node for Mediatek SOC usb3.0 phy

Required properties:
 - compatible : Should be "mediatek,mt8173-u3phy"
 - reg        : Offset and length of registers, the first is for mac domain,
	another for phy domain
 - power-domains: to enable usb's mtcmos
 - usb-wakeup-ctrl : to access usb wakeup control register
 - wakeup-src : 1: ip sleep wakeup mode; 2: line state wakeup mode; others
	means don't enable wakeup source of usb
 - u2port-num : number of usb2.0 ports to support which should be 1 or 2
 - clocks     : must support all clocks that phy need
 - clock-names: should be "wakeup_deb_p0", "wakeup_deb_p1" for wakeup
	debounce control clocks, and "u3phya_ref" for u3phya reference clock.

Example:

u3phy: usb-phy@11271000 {
	compatible = "mediatek,mt8173-u3phy";
	reg = <0 0x11271000 0 0x3000>,
	      <0 0x11280000 0 0x20000>;
	power-domains = <&scpsys MT8173_POWER_DOMAIN_USB>;
	usb-wakeup-ctrl = <&pericfg>;
	wakeup-src = <1>;
	u2port-num = <2>;
	clocks = <&perisys PERI_USB0>,
		 <&perisys PERI_USB1>,
		 <&apmixedsys CLK_APMIXED_REF2USB_TX>;
	clock-names = "wakeup_deb_p0",
		      "wakeup_deb_p1",
		      "u3phya_ref";
};

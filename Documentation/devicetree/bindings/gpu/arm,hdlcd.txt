ARM HDLCD

This is a driver for a display controller found on several development
platforms produced by ARM Ltd and in more modern of its' Fast Models.
The HDLCD is an RGB streamer that reads the data from a framebuffer
and sends it to a single HDMI transmitter.

Required properties:
- compatible: "arm,hdlcd"
- reg: Physical base address and length of the controller's registers.
- interrupts: One interrupt used by the controller to multiplex all
  the sources programmed in the interrupt mask register.
- clocks: A list of phandle + clock-specifier pairs, one for each entry
  in clock-names.
- clock-names: A list of clock names. For HDLD it should containt:
   * "pxlclk" for the clock feeding the output PLL of the controller.

Optional properties:
- i2c-slave: If the HDLCD is connected to an HDMI transmitter that is
  reacheable via i2c, then use the phandle of the DDC slave here.

Optional children:
- display-timings: If the HDLCD is emulated by the Fast Model, place the
  videomode(s) of the desired resolution(s) here. If multiple videomodes
  are being used, a 'native-mode' property should be used to indicate the
  preferred/default resolution. Refer to
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/video/display-timing.txt for details.


Example:

/ {
	...

	hdlcd@2b000000 {
		compatible = "arm,hdlcd";
		reg = <0 0x2b000000 0 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <0 85 4>;
		i2c-slave = <&dvi_i2c_slave>;
		clocks = <&oscclk5>;
		clock-names = "pxlclk";
	};

	/* DVI I2C bus */
	v2m_i2c_dvi: i2c@160000 {
		compatible = "arm,versatile-i2c";
		reg = <0x160000 0x1000>;

		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		dvi_i2c_slave: dvi-transmitter@39 {
			compatible = "sil,sii9022-tpi", "sil,sii9022";
			reg = <0x39>;
		};

		dvi-transmitter@60 {
			compatible = "sil,sii9022-cpi", "sil,sii9022";
			reg = <0x60>;
		};
	};

	...
};

[PATCH v2 0/xx]  Fix issues and factorize arm/arm64 capacity information code

Hi,

arm and arm64 topology.c share a lot of code related to parsing of capacity
information. This is v2 of a solution (based on Will's, Catalin's and Mark's
off-line suggestions) to move such common code in a single place:
drivers/base/arch_topology.c (by creating such file and conditionally compiling
it for arm and arm64 only).

First 5 patches are actually fixes for the current code.

Patch 6 is the actual refactoring.

Patch 7 removes one of the extern symbols by changing a bit the now common
code.

Patch 8 removes the remaining externs (as required by Russell during v1 review)
by creating new header file include/ linux/arch_topology.h file and including
that from arm, arm64 and drivers.

Last patch addresses Dietmar's comments to v1 and adds a 'drv_' prefix to
interfaces exported by drivers code and used by arch (and potentially others in
the future).

Changes from v1:

 - rebase on top of 4.10-rc6
 - fix licence issue as pointed out by Russell
 - propose a solution for removing all remaining externs
 - addressed Dietmar's comments regarding better namespaces

The set is based on top of linux/master (4.10-rc6 e387dc122fc7) and it is also
available from:

 git://linux-arm.org/linux-jl.git upstream/default_caps_factorize-v2

Best,

- Juri

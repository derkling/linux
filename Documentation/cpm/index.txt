   Constrained Power Manager (CPM) is a framework to support driver's
   local power/performances optimization policies.
   A mechanism to efficiently exchange information both between drivers
   and user-space allows to identify optimal syste-wide configurations.
   This is a nice method to find an agreement between resource providers
   and consumers and can turn out on better tradeoff between system
   QoS and power consumption.

   This framework is an evolution of QoSPM. It extend the basic idea
   of constraint management with an efficient mechanism for the
   identification of optimal system-wide feasible configuration.
